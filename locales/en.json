      "question_2": {
        "question": "Can epoxy resin design products be exposed to direct sunlight?",
        "answer": "While epoxy resin is UV-resistant to some extent, prolonged exposure to direct sunlight can cause discoloration and yellowing over time. It's best to keep epoxy resin design products away from direct sunlight or use them in areas with minimal sun exposure. If displaying your product in a sunny location is unavoidable, consider applying a protective coating or keeping it covered when not in use."

Handle them with care and avoid dropping or banging them against hard surfaces. When not in use, store them in a clean and dry area away from extreme temperatures and direct sunlight. Use padding or protective covers to prevent scratching or accidental damage."

      "question_4": {
        "question": "Can epoxy resin design products be used for hot items?",
        "answer": "Epoxy resin can withstand moderate heat, but it's generally not recommended to place hot items directly on the surface of epoxy resin design products. High temperatures can cause the resin to soften or warp. It's advisable to use trivets, coasters, or heat-resistant pads underneath hot objects to protect the resin finish and prevent any potential damage."
      },
      "question_5": {
        "question": "How do I maintain the glossy appearance of epoxy resin design products?",
        "answer": "Epoxy resin design products can maintain their glossy appearance with proper care. Avoid using abrasive materials or harsh cleaners that can dull the shine. Regularly dust the surface with a soft, lint-free cloth or use a gentle cleaner specifically designed for resin surfaces. Applying a thin coat of resin-safe polish or wax can also help restore and preserve the glossy finish."
      },
      "question_6": {
        "question": "What should I do if my epoxy resin design product gets scratched?",
        "answer": "Minor scratches on epoxy resin design products can often be buffed out using a fine-grit polishing compound or a resin-safe scratch remover. Follow the manufacturer's instructions or seek professional assistance if the scratch is deep or extensive. Preventing scratches is best achieved by handling the product with care and avoiding contact with abrasive surfaces."
